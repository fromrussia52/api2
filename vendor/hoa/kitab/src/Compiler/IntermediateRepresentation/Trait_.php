 *
 * In this example, a new trait `T` is built, with 2 attributes: `foo`

 *
 * ```php
 * $trait               = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Trait_('T');

 * $trait->attributes[] = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Attribute('bar');
 * $trait->methods[]    = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Method('f');
